## UPGRADE GUIDE ##

To upgrade to a new ProCamera2D version you should:
- Open a new empty scene
- Delete ProCamera2D folders (Assets/ProCamera2D and Assets/Gizmos/ProCamera2D)
- Import the new package




## QUICK START ##

Select your game camera (called Main Camera by default) and drag the ProCamera2D component file to the Main Camera GameObject.
You should now see the ProCamera2D component editor on the Inspector window when you select your Main Camera GameObject.
