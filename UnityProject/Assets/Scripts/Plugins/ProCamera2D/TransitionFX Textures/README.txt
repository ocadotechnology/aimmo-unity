## TRANSITIONS FX TEXTURES ##

The textures in this folder are to be used with the ProCamera2D TransitionsFX extension. 
Feel free to use and/adapt them for release in any project with ProCamera2D.

For best results I recommend the following:

- Black and white images
- Use images as small as possible for your game. It might be worth to create images in the same aspect ratio as your game.
- Import settings:
	- Texture Type: Texture
	- Alpha from Grayscale: Off
	- Wrap Mode: Clamp
	- Filter Mode: Bilinear (for smoother results) or Point (for harder edges)
	- Aniso Level: 0
	- Max Size: As small as possible
	- Format: Truecolor
